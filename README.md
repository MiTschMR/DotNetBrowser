# DotNetBrowser

# General Informations
The [.NET API Browser](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/) is a very good source for every .NET-based API from Microsoft. But there are sometimes situations where you don't want to have a website, searching for the specific Class, Method, Field etc. and then loading each Website itself, then realise it is somewhere else. 

I want to solve this problem with developing an application, where you can search the same way as in the .NET API Browser from Microsoft, with Icons for Classes, Methods and so on.
